About the Shiny App: Scatter Plot Generator for CDC15 Data

This Shiny app is designed to create scatter plots using a subset of the CDC15 experiment data from a gene expression study. The app allows users to visualize the relationship between any two selected time points within the experiment. Here's what it does:

Data Input: The app reads data from a text file (spellman.txt) containing gene expression levels for various time points. The data file is expected to have a header row and row names, with the relevant data for the CDC15 experiment spanning columns 23 to 46.
UI Design: The app provides a simple interface with sidebar controls for users to select the X and Y variables (corresponding to the desired time points) for plotting. Users can also choose the color for the scatter plot points from a predefined list of colors.
Server Logic: The server-side script is responsible for handling user input, creating the data subset based on selected time points, and rendering the scatter plot accordingly. The scatter plot is drawn with user-specified X and Y variables, and the selected color for the points. If the user changes the selections, the plot updates dynamically.
Plot Output: The scatter plot generated by the app shows the relationship between the selected time points, with custom axis labels and plot title. Users can use this visualization to explore patterns, correlations, or trends across the gene expression data for different time points.
This Shiny app provides an interactive and user-friendly way to analyze and visualize gene expression data, offering flexibility in selecting and comparing time points within the CDC15 experiment. It is a useful tool for researchers and students working with gene expression datasets, helping them gain insights into the relationships between different experiment phases or time points.
